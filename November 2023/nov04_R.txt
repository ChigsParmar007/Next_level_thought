today we are going to lean about the set and get method in the dart.




Getters and Setters, also called accessors and mutators, allow the program to initialize and retrieve the values of class fields respectively. 

Getters or accessors are defined using the get keyword.
Setters or mutators are defined using the set keyword.
A default getter/setter is associated with every class. However, the default ones can be overridden by explicitly defining a setter/ getter. 
A getter has no parameters and returns a value, and the setter has one parameter and does not return a value.


in the dart their are the simple sysntax to compare the language:-
let's see the syntax of the getter and setter method in the dart:-

 this syntax is use fot the Defining a getter
 
	Return_type  get identifier  
	{  
   	 	// statements	
	}

this syntax is use fot the Defining a setter  
	
	set identifier  
	{  
   		// statements
	}

let's understand with the simple example:-

 
class Student { 
String name; 
int age; 
	
String get stud_name { 
	return name; 
} 
	
void set stud_name(String name) { 
	this.name = name; 
} 
	
void set stud_age(int age) { 
	if(age<= 0) { 
		print("Age should be greater than 25"); 
	} else { 
		this.age = age; 
	} 
} 
	
int get stud_age { 
	return age;	 
} 
} 
void main() { 
Student s1 = new Student(); 
s1.stud_name = 'rima';
s1.stud_age = 0; 
print(s1.stud_name); 
print(s1.stud_age); 
}
