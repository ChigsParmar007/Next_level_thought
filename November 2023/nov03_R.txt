Today we are going to learn about the map:-

	The Map object is a simple Key/value pair .keys and values in a map  may be of any type.A Map is a dynamic collection.In other words,Maps can grow and shrink at runtime.

Maps can be declared in two ways:-

-Using Map Literals:-
-Using a Map constructor:-

Declaring a Map using Map Literals:-

To declare a Map using a Map constructor, we have two steps. First,declare the map and second , intiliaze the Map.

The Syntax to declare a map is as follows:-
	
	var identifier = new Map()

Now ,use the following syntax to initialise the Map:-

	map_name[key]=value

Let’s understand the with the example:-

Void main(){

	Var detail={‘userName’:’teams’,’password’:’password@123’};
	print(detail);
}

Let’s understand the with the basic example:-

addAll():-
	
	Adds all key-value pairs of other to this map.

clear():-

	removes all pairs from the map.

remove():-

	Removes key and its associated value, if present, from the map.

forEach():-

	Applies f to each key-value pair of the map.
