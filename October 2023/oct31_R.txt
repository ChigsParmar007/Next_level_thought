today we going to learn about the recursive function in dart:-
the recursive function is those function in which funation calls iteself.
it is good way to avaoid repeatedly calling the same funcation for the output..

let's understand this recusive funaction using the example:=


/// Computes the nth Fibonacci number.
int fibonacci(int n)
{
    // This is recursive function as it calls itself
    return n < 2 ? n : (fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2));
}
 
void main()
{
    var i = 20; // input
    print('fibonacci($i) = ${fibonacci(i)}');
}

output:-
fibonacci(20) = 6765

let's understand the another type of the function which is lambda function:-

They are the short way of representing a function in Dart. They are also called arrow function.
 But you should note that with lambda function you can return value for only one expression.

// Lambda function in Dart
 
void lambdademo() => print(" most Welcome for the dart learning pupose");
 
void main()
{
    lambdademo(); // Calling Lambda function
}
