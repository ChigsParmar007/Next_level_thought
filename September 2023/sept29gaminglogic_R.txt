create a number gussing game in dart


A random number will be genrated by the system and user will try
to guess if.
sample output:-
A number has been generated by the system from 1 to
100.try to guess it.75

Enter your guess:50
Your guess is low    , try again

Enter your guess:80
Your guess is  low high  , try again

congratulation, you have guessed the number

/*
binary search:-
in this concept their have the conncept is binary serach
in the binary search they have simple logic for exmple
their have the choice of the 1 to 100
first we look their half part like 50
their have three posibilities high or low or equal
->out put is this number is lowfrom the output we remove the half list from our list
so we enter the 75
->still their give the output is the
bassically we can do in the binary tree we crete the two part of the list ...
